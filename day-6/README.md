# DAY 06

## :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: **Day's explanation:**

⭐️ EX00 -> create a class that will receive color values either separated as "red, green, blue" or given as one rgb value.
Then assign each object the value given accordingly.

⭐️ EX01 -> create a class that will receive 3 coordinates values "x, y, z" and assign them in the corresponding objects.

## :warning: **NOTE:**

There was still more exercises to be done, but I didn't have the time to finish them.
