# DAY 09

## :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: **Day's explanation:**

⭐️ EX00 -> create a balloon that inflates 10px on clicking and deflate when mouse leaves it, as well as changing its color in the order
red, green & blue.

⭐️ EX01 -> create a calculator that receives only positive integers and alert out the result.

⭐️ EX02 -> create a todo list that saves its list items with cookies.

⭐️ EX03 -> re-do all the previous exercises but with JQuery.

⭐️ EX04 -> re-do the todo list but with AJAX instead of cookies.

## :warning: **NOTE:**

1- For the cookies to work, specially with google chrome, you have to run the html file with live server "vs code extension" or through some kind of server.

2- For AJAX the files needs to be running in a server folder, for example "mamp/apache2/htdocs".
