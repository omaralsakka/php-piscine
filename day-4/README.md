# DAY 04

## :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: **Day's explanation:**

⭐️ EX00 -> using GET method & session_start(), create a username and password, return the value ok if the values are correct when using curl.

⭐️ EX01 -> same as previous exercises, but this time serialize the password and save it hashed.

⭐️ EX02 -> modify the created account password, and again save it serialized and hashed.

⭐️ EX03 -> create a function that returns true or false to authenticate a user login and password.

⭐️ EX04 -> combine everything done so far, then create a chat app that upon login, 2 users can text each others.
